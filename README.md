IntelliJ IDEA color schema based on the Dracula theme for use with cursive clojure.

> Warning. This color scheme is configured "just enough" to work with my daily usage and is by no means intended to be complete or has been tested with other languages or plugins YMMV. I created it mainly because i was sick of looking at the default intellij color scheme when writing clojure
